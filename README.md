# BurninateHelloWorld
Burninating all the Hello World and their Thatched-roof Cottages!!!


Trogdor!

Trogdor!

Trogdor was a man

I mean, he was a dragon man

Or maybe he was just a dragon

But he was still Trogdor!

Trogdor!

Trogdor!

Burninating the countryside,

Burninating the peasants

Burninating all the peoples

And their thatched-roof cottages!

Thatched-roof cottages!

Whoa, this has wicked dueling guitar solos

It's like squeedly versus meedley over here

Go squeedly!

Go squeedly!

Squeedly wins!

When all the land is in ruins

And burnination has forsaken the countryside

Only one guy will remain

My money's on

Trogdor!

Trogdor!

And the Trogdor comes in the night . .
